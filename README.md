## Overview

DIVG replaces fragmented, audit-heavy impact reporting with a decentralised verification graph anchored to two complementary distributed ledgers. The platform produces a single Verifiable Impact Credential (VIC) per claim, jointly attested by a stratified panel of stakeholders under an incentive-compatible peer-prediction mechanism — eliminating the need for repeated per-investor audits.

> *"The process happens once and is shared many times."*

The system serves three primary participants: **Firms** (e.g. MSM portfolio companies) that issue impact claims; **Validators** (stratified across employees, experts, beneficiaries) that attest claims under Compact SPP scoring; and **Investors** (e.g. LPs) that independently verify VICs through dual-path on-chain queries — without relying on the platform operator.

---

## Architecture

The verification model is deliberately decoupled across two ledgers and anchored to a thesis-grade game-theoretic mechanism:

```
[Firm] → Submits claim → SUI Move smart contract → Claim object created
                                                        ↓
                                       Stratified validator panel (VRF)
                                                        ↓
              ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┐
              │  Stage 1 (commit):  y_i  prior belief hashed on-chain               │
              │  Stage 2 (reveal):  x_i  binary signal report after investigation   │
              │  Compact SPP:       Score_i = R_q(shadow_i, x_j) − c_i              │
              └─────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                                                        ↓
                            VIC minted unconditionally on SUI
                            ─────────────┬─────────────
                                         ↓
                    Hedera HCS audit log (every state transition)
                                         ↓
                    [Investor] → Dual-path on-chain query
```

**Dual-path verification:**
- **SUI object state** — current VIC metadata (D_final, Conf(c), S_agg)
- **Hedera HCS audit trail** — immutable history of every validation event

**Key design principle:** The VIC is minted *unconditionally* for every completed round. D_final, Conf(c), and S_agg are embedded as **metadata**, not minting gates. The platform is a non-custodial transparency layer, not a gatekeeper.

## Mathematical Core

The mechanism implements the Compact Shadow Private-Prior Peer Prediction protocol from Witkowski &amp; Parkes (2012):

```
shadow_i  =  (1 − 2δ) · y_i  +  2δ · x_i        (δ = 0.2)
Score_i   =  R_q(shadow_i, x_j)  −  c_i         (x_j = random reference peer)
```

Truth-telling is a strict Nash Equilibrium regardless of other validators' actions — the property that makes this mechanism appropriate when validators from heterogeneous stakeholder groups hold different subjective beliefs about the same claim.

Long-run reputation uses the Roth-Erev reinforcement learning update (Tesfatsion, 2005):

```
R_i(t+1)  =  clamp( R_i(t) + η )   if x_i = D_final
          =  clamp( R_i(t) − λ )   otherwise
```

Confidence score:

```
Conf(C)   =  α · A  +  β · Ψ  +  γ · T          (α + β + γ = 1)
```

Where A = global agreement density, Ψ = inter-group divergence penalty, T = path stability coefficient.

## User Roles

- **Firm** — Registers via DID (WaaP), submits claim hash on SUI, receives VIC after validation
- **Validator (Employee/Expert/Beneficiary)** — Joins pool via DID, drawn into panels by VRF, commits prior y_i, reveals signal x_i, receives Compact SPP payment
- **Investor** — Queries VIC on SUI + Hedera HCS independently, computes σ(C) against own threshold θ, makes capital deployment decision
- **Platform admin** — Holds AdminCap, registers entities, mints VICs after backend computes consensus

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites (system-wide — install once)

```bash
brew install node python@3.11 sui
```

### Installation (everything else is project-local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabaazdn73/DIVG.git
cd DIVG

# One-shot installer — installs all deps INSIDE the project folder
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

This creates `backend/node_modules`, `backend/.venv`, `frontend/node_modules`, and `sources/build` — nothing pollutes your global Python or npm.

### Run tests (no deployment needed)

```bash
sui move test
```

22 unit tests cover the Compact SPP math, Roth-Erev reputation, unconditional VIC minting, and access control. Expected output: `Test result: OK. Total tests: 22; passed: 22; failed: 0`.

### Deploy Move package to SUI testnet

```bash
sui client switch --env testnet
sui client faucet              # get testnet SUI
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

Note the output:
- `PackageID` → `SUI_PACKAGE_ID`
- Shared `Registry` object → `SUI_REGISTRY_ID`
- `AdminCap` owned object → `SUI_ADMIN_CAP`

### Configure backend

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Fill SUI_* and HEDERA_* credentials
# Hedera testnet account: https://portal.hedera.com
```

### Run dev servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
npm run dev:backend            # http://localhost:4000

# Terminal 2 — frontend
npm run dev:frontend           # http://localhost:5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — click **"Seed Winnow / MSM case"** on the Overview page to populate the validator pool, then run a validation round.

---

## Live Demo

**→ <https://divg.vercel.app>**

A live testnet deployment is available. From the Overview page, click any of the 5 layer cards to drill into:

1. **Identity Layer** — Register validators with DIDs; view stratified pool
2. **Claim Layer** — Submit impact claim, anchor on SUI, log to Hedera HCS
3. **Validation Layer** — Run live round with Compact SPP scoring table per validator
4. **Credential Layer** — Inspect minted VIC, view dual-path on-chain anchoring
5. **Advisory Layer** — Adjust θ, compute σ(C), see PROCEED / CAUTION output

The standalone offline VIC verifier (`verify-standalone.js`) allows fully independent, platform-free verification of any exported VIC JSON file:

```bash
npm run verify ./example-vic.json
```

---

## Mechanism Integrity — Why This Matters

**For SUI Overflow:**
The Move package demonstrates parallel execution of registry mutation, claim submission, and VIC minting as independent shared objects. The split into immutable core (`divg.move`) and upgradeable scoring (`scoring.move`) implements the **R&D principle** from the thesis: the peer-prediction rule can be replaced via package upgrade without touching identity, claim, or VIC state.

**For Hedera:**
Every state transition (`entity_registered`, `claim_submitted`, `validation_round_complete`, `vic_minted`) produces a Hedera HCS message — an immutable audit trail anchored by the Hedera Governing Council. This is the same trust signal used by the Government of Maharashtra's State Carbon Bank (built on Hedera EcoGuard, 2025).

**For the MSc thesis:**
The implementation operationalises the mathematical model from Chapter 3 exactly — same δ = 0.2, same τ_g = 0.5, same Roth-Erev rates η = 0.05 / λ = 0.03, same confidence weights α = β = 0.4, γ = 0.2, same unconditional VIC minting principle — making it a live, verifiable instance of the 5,000-round Mesa simulation reported in Section 3.4.

## Intentional Demo Tradeoffs

This MVP was built to validate the core scientific mechanism and demonstrate seamless multi-stakeholder UX across three audiences (SUI Overflow, Hedera funding, MSc thesis defence). The following architectural tradeoffs were made deliberately. Each is explicitly disclosed and is resolved in the production roadmap.

| Demo Simplification | Reason | Production Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Custodial transaction signing** — Backend holds the SUI keypair and signs all transactions on behalf of registered validators, firms, and investors | Removes wallet friction for evaluators; matches the "Web2 UX, Web3 infrastructure" goal | **WaaP (Wallet-as-a-Protocol)** via Ika's 2PC-MPC threshold signing. Each validator holds one key share, platform holds the other; transactions are co-signed without either party reconstructing the full key. Specified in Chapter 3.5.3 v of the thesis. |
| Deterministic DID generation from email hash | Speed of onboarding for demo testing | Real OAuth or email-OTP identity verification before DID issuance |
| Validator pool augmented with simulated peers when real pool < N | Demo viability without 30 real human validators per round | Real validator marketplace with DID-anchored applications; simulated path retired |
| ABM signal model approximates field investigation | Speed of demo execution | Actual claim-investigation workflows per stakeholder group, with off-chain evidence linked to the on-chain commit-reveal |
| In-memory state store in backend | Speed and simplicity | PostgreSQL (relational state) + Walrus/IPFS (claim evidence storage) |
| Backend orchestrates Hedera HCS submissions with platform credentials | Operational simplicity | Hedera SDK calls from per-validator wallets, sponsored via Hedera fee-payer accounts |

### What is *not* simplified

The **mechanism math is bit-identical to the thesis specification.** The Compact SPP scoring, Roth-Erev reputation update, unanimity rule, secondary validation cycle trigger, confidence formula, and unconditional VIC minting principle are all implemented exactly as Chapter 3 describes. This is verified by **25 Move unit tests** covering every formula in Section 3.5, including the worked Winnow / MSM example (prior y=0.75 → shadow=0.85 → Rq=0.978 → payment=0.878). Cryptographically, the demo is a custodial-MVP; **mechanistically, it is the thesis.**

### The custodial-MVP pattern

This is the same intentional tradeoff used in the author's previous IOTA-based academic recommendation system (TrustCycle, 2026). Both demos prove the **scientific contribution** (the mechanism design) while postponing the **identity-infrastructure layer** (true non-custodial keys) to the production roadmap. The two paths are functionally identical from the user's perspective; only the key custody model differs.
